Different types of hotkeys to modify the physics on the game.

Wind

- Hold 1 and press M(More) to add rigth wind.

- Hold 1 and press L(Less) to add left wind.

- Hold 1 and press U(UP) to add wind going up.

- Hold 1 and press D(Down) to add wind going down.


Atmosphere Desnity

- Hold 2 and press M(More) to add atmosphere density.

- Hold 2 and press L(Less) to remove atmosphere density.


Mass and radius

- Hold 3 and press M(More) to add mass and radius.

- Hold 3 and press L(Less) to remove mass and radius.


Aerodynamic Drag coefficient

- Hold 4 and press M(More) to add aerodynamic drag coefficient.

- Hold 4 and press L(Lore) to remove aerodynamic drag coefficient.

Aerodynamic Lift coefficient


- Hold 5 and press M(More) to add aerodynamic lift coefficient.

- Hold 5 and press L(Less) to remove aerodynamic lift coefficient.


Coefficients of friction

- Hold 6 and press M(More) to add coefficients of friction.

- Hold 6 and press L(Less) to remove coefficients of friction.


Coefficients of restitution

- Hold 7 and press M(More) to add coefficients of restitution.

- Hold 7 and press L(Less) to remove coefficients of restitution.


Water density

- Hold 8 and press M(More) to add water density.

- Hold 8 and press L(Less) to remove water density.


God Mode (Free Movment)

- Press G to toggle God Mode

- Press TAB to toggle between different control schemes (Position/Velocity/Momentum/Acceleration/Force)


Reset ball position

- Press B to reset ball position and physics


Enable/Dissable ball physics

- Press P to togge physics


Integrators

- Press I to toggle between different integrators (Verlet/Backward Euler/Forward Euler)


Collisoners

IMPORTANT: Toggle God Mode on and off before taking your first shot to get it to work properly

- Press C to toggle between different collisioners(M1:TP the ball to the floor/M2:TP the ball to the relative position/M3:Without handling collisions)
- Press W, A, S, D to move in God Mode

Gameplay

- Press SPACE to apply the force of a blow to the ball (Like the blow of a golf club)
- Press LEFT and RIGHT ARROW to change the angle of direction of the ball
- Press UP and DOWN ARROW to change the power of the shot
